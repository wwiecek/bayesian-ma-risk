# bayesian-ma-risk

Minimal repository for code and examples related to Bayesian meta-analysis model for risk assessment of chemicals that can be applied in toxicology or pharmacometric modelling.

The reference pulication for this model  is:

Wiecek, Witold, Jean-Lou Dorne, Nadia Quignot, Camille Bechaux, and Billy Amzal. ‘A Generic Bayesian Hierarchical Model for the Meta-Analysis of Human Population Variability in Kinetics and Its Applications in Chemical Risk Assessment’. Computational Toxicology 12 (November 2019): 100106. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comtox.2019.100106>.

This repo contains PDF presentations based on this paper as well as the generic Stan code. If anyone requests it I'm happy to share the model code used to produce case studies. The .Rmd file for PDF presentation(s) will not run without source data (which I do not own), please contact me directly if you need it.
